* Flap detection
* Figure out proper logger lvl for each msg. So a person can choose only to log local6.warn and get only state transition messages and not any of the watch chatter.
* Proper implementation of the cpu and mem watches. Possibly not forking to use ps ax?
* Better error output than just vanilla exception traces
* Better output for cli commands than just "ok"
* munin support?
