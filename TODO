* Figure out proper logger lvl for each msg. So a person can choose only to log local6.warn and get only state transition messages and not any of the watch chatter.
* Better error output than just vanilla exception traces
* Better output for cli commands than just "ok"
* munin support?


Issues encountered in the wild
------------------------------

1. There were weird dependencies on xml-simple and builder gems when you try to use the bluepill cli.
2. Whenever bluepill executes user specified commands (like start_command, stop_command, restart_command), it should execute it in such a way that it does not affect the stability of bluepill daemon itself.
3. Whenever a command is sent to a process group, execute them in parallel for each process in the group instead of serially.
4. Issuing commands to the running bluepill daemon can trigger flapping condition to be triggered.
